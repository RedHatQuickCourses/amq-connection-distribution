=== Code Examples

The code examples demonstrate how to interact with ActiveMQ Artemis:

*   Developing *producer applications* to send messages to queues, such as publishing price updates.
*   Developing *consumer applications* to receive and process messages from queues.
*   Illustrating how clients connect to a clustered Artemis environment, leveraging `JmsPoolConnectionFactory`.
*   Showcasing various message publishing and consumption patterns, including the use of `@JmsListener` for simpler consumer creation in frameworks like Spring Boot.
