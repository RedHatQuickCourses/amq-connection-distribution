#  Steps to deploy ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift

== ActiveMQ Artemis Deployment on OpenShift

Deploying ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift provides a robust, scalable, and manageable environment for your message-oriented middleware (MOM) needs. OpenShift, a container application platform based on Kubernetes, offers benefits such as automated deployment, scaling, and management of applications in containers. Here's a step-by-step guide to deploying ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift:

1. **Install the Red Hat AMQ Operator**

   The Red Hat AMQ Operator simplifies the deployment and management of ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift. To install it, follow the official Red Hat documentation: [Installing the AMQ Operator](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.3/html/deploying_amq_brokers_on_openshift/installing-broker-operator-openshift).

2. **Create an ActiveMQArtemis custom resource**

   After installing the AMQ Operator, create a custom resource for ActiveMQ Artemis. This YAML file defines the desired state for your broker deployment.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
   kind: ActiveMQArtemis
   metadata:
     name: ex-artemis
   spec:
     deploymentPlan:
       size: 2 # Number of broker pods
       persistenceEnabled: true # Enable persistent storage
       journalDirectory: /data/journal # Journal directory for each broker
       largeMessagesDirectory: /data/large-messages # Large messages directory for each broker
       securityEnabled: false # Disable security for simplicity
       managementRPCAddress: 0.0.0.0 # Enable management RPC
   ```

   Save this configuration as `activemq-artemis-cr.yaml` and apply it using `oc apply -f activemq-artemis-cr.yaml`.

3. **Create a Service**

   To expose the ActiveMQ Artemis brokers to clients, create a Service object. This example uses TCP protocol on port 61617.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: broker-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: broker
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 61617
         targetPort: 61617
   ```

   Save this configuration as `broker-service.yaml` and apply it using `oc apply -f
