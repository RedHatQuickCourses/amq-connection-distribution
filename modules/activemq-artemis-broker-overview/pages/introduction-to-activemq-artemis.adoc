#  Introduction to ActiveMQ Artemis

== ActiveMQ Artemis Broker Overview

ActiveMQ Artemis is a high-performance, open-source message-oriented middleware (MOM) broker that facilitates reliable communication between distributed applications. It is designed to handle a large number of messages and provide features essential for modern distributed systems, such as loose coupling, scalability, faster response, high availability, and reliability.

### Key Components

ActiveMQ Artemis Brokers consist of several key components that work together to ensure efficient message handling:

1. **Message Queues**: These are the primary destinations for messages in Artemis. A message queue ensures that each message is processed exactly once by a single consumer.

2. **Topics**: Topics are publish-subscribe channels that allow multiple consumers to receive messages. Messages published to a topic are delivered to all active consumers subscribed to that topic.

3. **Addresses**: Addresses are logical destinations that map to queues or topics. They provide a way to organize and route messages within the broker.

### Configuration Options for High Performance and Reliability

ActiveMQ Artemis offers various configuration options to optimize performance and ensure reliability:

1. **Persistence**: Artemis can store messages persistently on disk, ensuring that messages are not lost in case of broker failure. This feature is crucial for mission-critical applications.

2. **Page Memory**: Artemis uses a page memory feature to store messages in memory, which significantly improves performance for high-throughput applications.

3. **Journal and Large Messages**: Artemis supports journaling for messages, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of large messages.

4. **Clustering**: Artemis can be deployed in a cluster configuration, where multiple brokers work together to provide high availability and scalability.

5. **Security**: Artemis supports various security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, to protect sensitive data.

By understanding and effectively utilizing these components and configuration options, developers can leverage ActiveMQ Artemis to build robust, scalable, and reliable distributed applications.
