#  Solutions for Even Message Distribution

=== Solutions for Even Message Distribution

Achieving even message distribution across an ActiveMQ Artemis cluster is crucial for high performance and throughput, avoiding bottlenecks and inefficient message handling.

*   **Problem**:
    *   Applications typically establish a single connection to a single broker, creating a bottleneck.
    *   Reliance on broker-side message redistribution introduces significant overhead, reduces overall cluster throughput, and can force high-volume queues to page pending messages to disk.

*   **Solution Approach**:
    *   Deploying a multi-node ActiveMQ Artemis cluster (e.g., a two-node cluster on OpenShift using the Red Hat AMQ Operator).
    *   Implementing client-side load balancing strategies and configuring client connection factories for multiple brokers. This approach directly distributes messages evenly across cluster members, optimizing client connectivity for high throughput and avoiding the overhead of broker-side message redistribution.
