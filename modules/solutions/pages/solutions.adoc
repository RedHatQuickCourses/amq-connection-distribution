Solutions for robust messaging systems like ActiveMQ Artemis focus on ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient message handling.

*   **ActiveMQ Artemis Clustering**: Connects multiple broker instances to form a single, logical messaging system, distributing workloads and enhancing fault tolerance.
*   **High Availability (HA) and Automatic Failover**: Ensures continuous operation and data integrity by providing redundant brokers that can automatically take over if an active broker fails.
*   **Server-side Message Load Balancing**: Distributes messages efficiently across available consumers or cluster nodes, preventing bottlenecks and optimizing resource utilization.
*   **Scaling with Competing Consumers**: Allows multiple consumers to process messages concurrently from the same queue, significantly increasing message throughput and processing capacity.
*   **Deploying ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift**: Leverages the OpenShift platform for containerized deployment, offering orchestration, scaling, and management capabilities.
*   **Utilizing the Red Hat AMQ Operator**: Simplifies the deployment and management of ActiveMQ Artemis instances on OpenShift through Kubernetes-native automation.
*   **Configuring ActiveMQArtemis Custom Resources for Clustering**: Defines and manages clustered Artemis environments on OpenShift using declarative Custom Resources, streamlining configuration.
