#  Acceptor Configuration

=== Acceptor Configuration

Acceptor configuration defines how AMQ Broker accepts incoming client connections. It involves:

*   Setting up network listeners (acceptors) for various messaging protocols like AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.
*   Configuring network settings, binding addresses, and ports.
*   Implementing SSL/TLS to secure client-broker communication.
