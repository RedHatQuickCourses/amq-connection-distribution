=== Security Configuration

Security configuration for AMQ Broker involves safeguarding message access and communication. Key aspects include:

*   **Authentication:** Implementing mechanisms like JAAS or LDAP to verify user identities.
*   **Authorization:** Configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage user permissions for sending and receiving messages.
*   **Secure Communication:** Setting up SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between clients and the broker.
*   **OpenShift Integration:** Leveraging OpenShift's authentication features for a unified security approach.
