#  The Problem with a Multi-Node Broker

**The Problem with a Multi-Node Broker**

- **Uneven Message Distribution**: In a multi-node broker setup, messages may not be evenly distributed across brokers. This is particularly problematic when using modern application frameworks like Spring Boot or Quarkus, which create and scale connections on demand.

- **Connection Pooling Issues**: Without a proper connection pooling mechanism, each application connection is typically served by a single broker. This leads to an uneven load distribution, as one broker may handle significantly more connections than others.

- **Impact on Message Distribution**: The disparity in connection handling between brokers can result in uneven message distribution. This issue is exacerbated when non-negative redistribution-delay is configured for an address, as it can reduce cluster throughput and even lead to paging pending messages to disk for queues with a high incoming message rate.

- **Consequences**: Uneven load distribution can negatively impact the performance and reliability of the messaging system, potentially leading to bottlenecks and decreased overall throughput.
