=== Hands-on Lab: Deploying and Interacting with an ActiveMQ Artemis Cluster

This lab provides practical experience with ActiveMQ Artemis clustering on OpenShift, focusing on high availability and even message distribution.

Key activities include:

*   Setting up the OpenShift environment and installing the Red Hat AMQ Operator.
*   Deploying a two-node ActiveMQ Artemis cluster using an `ActiveMQArtemis` custom resource.
*   Developing and deploying client applications to interact with the cluster.
*   Observing message distribution across cluster members to ensure efficient load balancing.
*   Testing failover scenarios to validate the High Availability (HA) capabilities of the cluster.
