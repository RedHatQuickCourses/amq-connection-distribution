#  Client-Side Challenges

=== Client-Side Challenges

Client-side interactions with an ActiveMQ Artemis cluster can present several challenges, impacting performance and message distribution:

*   **Bottlenecks from Single Connection:** Connecting a single client to only one broker can create performance bottlenecks and limit throughput.
*   **Impact of Default Load Balancing:** Default client load-balancing policies may not evenly distribute connections or messages, leading to inefficient use of cluster resources and reduced overall throughput due to message redistribution.
*   **Connection Disparity:** Modern application frameworks, which scale connections on demand, can create a disparity in connections between broker nodes, especially when consumers are not long-lasting or disconnect frequently. This disparity can extend to consumers, leading to uneven message processing.
*   **Risk of Paging Messages:** High-volume queues, particularly when messages are not evenly distributed, face the risk of paging messages to disk, which can degrade performance.
