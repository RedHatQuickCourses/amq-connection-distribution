#  OpenShift Introduction

=== OpenShift Introduction

OpenShift is Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform for container orchestration, automating application deployment, scaling, and management.

Key concepts include:

*   *Projects*: A way to organize and isolate resources for different teams or applications.
*   *Pods*: The smallest deployable units, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
*   *Deployments*: Manages the rollout and scaling of application Pods.
*   *Services*: Provides a stable network endpoint for Pods.
*   *Routes*: Exposes services externally with a user-friendly hostname.

Deploying applications on OpenShift offers benefits such as simplified development workflows, built-in security features, and robust operational capabilities.
