#  Storage Configuration

=== Storage Configuration

Storage configuration for Red Hat AMQ Broker involves setting up how message data is persisted to ensure durability and reliability.

*   **Message Persistence and Journaling**: Defines how messages are written to disk for recovery in case of broker failure. Journaling is a high-performance write-ahead log for message storage.
*   **Data Directories and Journal Settings**: Configures the physical locations where broker data and journal files are stored, including parameters for journal size and rotation.
*   **OpenShift Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**: Integrates broker storage with OpenShift's persistent storage mechanisms, allowing dynamic provisioning and management of underlying storage resources.
*   **Managing Broker Data and Message Logs**: Involves setting up and maintaining storage for message journals, configuration files, and other critical broker data.
