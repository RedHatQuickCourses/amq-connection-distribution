#  Address Configuration

xref:amq-on-openshift:addresses-and-queues.adoc[Address Configuration] in AMQ Broker involves defining virtual destinations for messages.

*   **Addresses and Queues:** Create logical endpoints (addresses) where producers send messages, and consumers retrieve them from queues.
*   **Routing Types:** Determine how messages are delivered to queues, such as `anycast` (point-to-point) or `multicast` (publish-subscribe).
*   **Message Grouping:** Configure messages with a specific `groupID` to ensure sequential processing by a single consumer.
*   **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ):** Set up a dedicated queue where messages are sent if they cannot be delivered or processed successfully.
*   **Address Settings:** Apply various configurations like expiry, max delivery attempts, and message retention policies to addresses.
